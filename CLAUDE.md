# Project Instructions

## Commit and Push Incrementally

Always commit and push changes incrementally as you work. Do not batch all changes into a single commit at the end.

- After completing each logically distinct change (e.g., updating a pipeline file, adding a test, modifying the README), commit and push immediately before moving on to the next change.
- Each commit should be small and focused on a single concern.
- Push after every commit — do not accumulate unpushed local commits.
- Write concise commit messages that explain *why* the change was made, not just what changed.
